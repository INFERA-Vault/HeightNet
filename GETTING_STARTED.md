# Getting started after pulling the repo

This is the guide for someone who has just cloned HeightNet and wants to run
it without guessing what to do.

## 1. Clone the repository

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/INFERA-Vault/HeightNet.git HeightNet
cd HeightNet
```

If the folder already exists:

```powershell
cd D:\projects\HeightNet
git pull
```

## 2. Check Python

```powershell
python --version
```

Python 3.10 or newer is required. If `python` is not found, install Python
from <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and enable **Add Python to PATH**.

## 3. Create a private project environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run this once in the same terminal:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## 4. Install the project

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[model,remote,test]"
```

## 5. Run a basic check

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

If Windows reports that the paging file is too small while loading Torch, the
machine needs more virtual memory. The project files are not the cause of that
error.

## 6. Get the trained model

The model weights are not stored in Git because they are large. Ask the team
for these files:

```text
depth_anything_v2_gamus_fulltrain_epoch3_stable.pt
gamus_semantic_head_fulltrain_epoch1.pt
```

Place them here:

```text
data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_gamus_fulltrain_epoch3_stable.pt
data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/gamus_semantic_head_fulltrain_epoch1.pt
```

Check that they exist:

```powershell
Test-Path data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_gamus_fulltrain_epoch3_stable.pt
Test-Path data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/gamus_semantic_head_fulltrain_epoch1.pt
```

Both commands must print `True`.

## 7. Download a small GAMUS sample

You do not need the full 80 GB dataset just to understand the project. Start
with 20 training scenes:

```powershell
python scripts/download_gamus_subset.py `
  --split train `
  --count 20 `
  --workers 8
```

Each scene has three matching files:

```text
RGB image + AGL height map + land cover map
```

For full retraining, download the complete train, validation, and test splits:

```powershell
python scripts/download_gamus_subset.py --split train --count 2685
python scripts/download_gamus_subset.py --split val --count 576
python scripts/download_gamus_subset.py --split test --count 576
```

The data is saved under `data/gamus_raw/`. It is ignored by Git and should not
be pushed to the repository.

## 8. Run on a normal image

Put any PNG or JPG inside a local folder, for example:

```text
D:\heightnet_inputs\sample.png
```

Run:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipeline.py `
  --input D:\heightnet_inputs\sample.png `
  --checkpoint data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_gamus_fulltrain_epoch3_stable.pt `
  --output-dir data/pipeline_outputs
```

This creates a relative height map. It is not in real metres because PNG and
JPG files do not contain map location and scale information.

## 9. Run on a GeoTIFF

A GeoTIFF must have a CRS and map transform. You also need a coarse ground
elevation raster covering the same area.

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipeline.py `
  --input D:\heightnet_inputs\scene_rgb.tif `
  --checkpoint data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_gamus_fulltrain_epoch3_stable.pt `
  --sure-calibration-report reports/sure_cal_256res_calibration.json `
  --semantic-checkpoint data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/gamus_semantic_head_fulltrain_epoch1.pt `
  --ground D:\heightnet_inputs\coarse_ground.tif `
  --output-dir data/pipeline_outputs `
  --output-prefix my_scene
```

The important outputs are:

```text
my_scene_relative_depth.tif
my_scene_predicted_agl.tif
my_scene_estimated_dsm.tif
my_scene_calibration_uncertainty.tif
my_scene_calibration_confidence.tif
my_scene_pipeline_metadata.json
```

## 10. Make the 3D terrain

```powershell
python scripts/export_terrain_mesh.py `
  --rgb D:\heightnet_inputs\scene_rgb.tif `
  --elevation data\pipeline_outputs\my_scene_estimated_dsm.tif `
  --output data\pipeline_outputs\my_scene_terrain.obj `
  --stride 8 `
  --vertical-exaggeration 2.0
```

The OBJ, MTL, texture PNG, and metadata JSON must stay together.

## 11. Open the browser viewer

Start a local server:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/viewer/> in a browser. Select the matching OBJ,
MTL, texture, and metadata files.

## 12. Open the result in QGIS

Add the RGB GeoTIFF and the estimated DSM GeoTIFF as raster layers. Then open:

```text
View → 3D Map Views → New 3D Map View
```

In the settings window choose:

```text
Terrain type: DEM (Raster Layer)
Elevation: my_scene_estimated_dsm
Vertical scale: 2.0
```

Keep the RGB layer visible. It supplies the texture. The confidence layer is
only for checking where the calibration is more or less reliable.

## 13. Run the connected browser workspace

The simple portal already works with Python only. The imported React workspace
needs Node once to build its browser files:

```powershell
cd portal/workspace-src
npm install
npm run build
cd ../..
python scripts/serve_portal.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/workspace/`. Choose an input file and click
**Run model**. It uses the same backend and opens the same real terrain viewer.

When the run finishes, you can click the 2D result to inspect the generated
DSM height and local slope. To check accuracy, add a reference DSM GeoTIFF or a
GCP CSV and click **Run validation**. The GCP CSV must have `x,y,reference_m`
columns in the prediction raster CRS. The portal does not invent accuracy data:
without a real reference, it cannot produce a valid accuracy claim.

## What the project is doing

```text
RGB image
    ↓
relative depth from the trained model
    ↓
SURE-Cal changes the scale using land cover
    ↓
coarse ground elevation is added
    ↓
DSM GeoTIFF and 3D terrain mesh
```

## Common mistakes

**Model file not found**

The checkpoint has not been copied into `data/gamus_raw/checkpoints/`.

**Only relative output appears**

The input is not a georeferenced GeoTIFF, or calibration and ground files were
not supplied.

**The 3D view is blank**

Check that the DSM has a CRS, that the 3D terrain elevation is set to the DSM,
and that the map is zoomed to the layer extent.

**Hugging Face asks for a token**

The public model or data request is unauthenticated. The warning is usually
safe for a small run, but a token gives better download limits.
